## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I really struggled with the background, for some reason my background was not covering up the entire webpage and because of it i had to do some tweaks around the image but still it is not perfect. Getting the right box-shadow was also a little tricky. It took me a lot of googling and reading through mdn docs to finally get it somewhat right.
My friend raghav [https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Rgulati4657] also helped me a lot.

### Continued development

Although I am still currently learning css, I felt this was a nice project to practice. I still have to work on my flexbox and grid layouts. 

### Useful resources

- [(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)] - This is an amazing resource for learning web dev stuff and whenever i was getting stuck i went here to learn and clear my doubts.
